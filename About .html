    <h1>Benefits of Walking your Dog on the Beach</h1>

    <h3>Adequate Space</h3>
    <p>The beach affords adequate space for a dog to walk and even have a swim without disturbing our beach users.  
        A well trained dog on a leash can get the exercise they need while under control of their owner.
        A regular walk is vitally important for your pet's health too. Obesity in pets is associated with a number of medical complaints including osteoarthritis,
        cardiovascular disease, liver disease and insulin resistance. Most dogs need to be walked at least once each day, though some dogs,
        particularly very active dogs, may require more. A walk on the beach can make a dog very happy. They love to check out the sights and smells
        and will really look forward to spending time with you. A dog that doesn't receive sufficient exercise can easily become bored or
        destructive.

    <h3>Cooling Down</h3>
  <p>Most dogs enjoy the water and taking your dog for a bit of a swim is both fun for the dog
      and tired them out.  A tired dog is a happy dog.

  <h3>Health Benefits to Owner</h3>
  <p>A brisk walk on the beach helps to increase your energy and stamina. The added resistance of the 
      sand helps to enhance your balance and coordination. Dog owners enjoy numerous health and social benefits 
      by walking their dog a few times a week. Benefits include improved cardiovascular fitness, lower blood pressure, 
      stronger muscles and bones (built up by walking regularly), and decreased stress.
